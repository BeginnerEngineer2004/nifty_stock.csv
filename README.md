# Project Description

The Nifty Stocks Visualization Project focuses on analyzing and visualizing stock market data of companies listed under the Nifty index. The goal of this project is to provide insights into stock price trends, returns, and volatility across different categories and symbols using advanced data visualization techniques.


# Key Objectives:

- To explore daily stock returns, volatility, and price movements across various categories.

- To identify patterns and relationships between stock metrics such as open, close, high, low, and price ranges.

- To visually represent sector-wise and category-wise performance of Nifty-listed companies.

- To provide an interactive and comparative analysis of stocks for better financial decision-making.
